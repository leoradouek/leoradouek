## Hello World, I'm Leora ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a background in pharmacy. 

I came across coding in my spare time during the pandemic and immediately loved it! After several months of self-learning, I enrolled in the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, a 17-week immersive fullstack program, to develop my skills to turn my new-found hobby into a career.
